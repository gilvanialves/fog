Precedence must be given to the the Rule with the largest number of: \n * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. * Characters in a matching path. * Header matches. * Query param matches. \n If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by   \"{namespace}/{name}\". \n If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence, matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.",
